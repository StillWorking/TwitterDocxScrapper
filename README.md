# Twitter Doc Scraper

Twitter Doc Scraper is a scraper designed to take tweets from an individual and return them in a handy DOCX file. The project idea came from reading Reddit comments from Manchester United fans that their 'Tier 1' Journalist stated that Jadon Sancho will be bought in the Summer of 2020. The file this scraper creates is to get all the tweets from said 'Tier 1' and shove them in the faces of said smug Reddit users.
